# Problem
- Homelessness is a national epidemic
- Bad luck can strike anyone at anytime
- Plenty of resources, though no big database that also serves as a rehabilitative venue and resource center for at-risk people

# Initial Idea
- Inspired by a Serv-a-palooza event hosted by Qualcomm. Event coordinator discussed the growing homeless population in San Diego and how many people don't have the rehabilitation, or long term commitment and support from others to get them on their feet, that they needed.
- Many cities already have interactive screens on the side of buildings and at bus stops. Anyone can interact with them - this can serve as a resource for people in need.

# What We Created
- Website and Android App where those in need can get immediate access to 911, a general hotline, and any other resources that they might need within their area.
- People are encouraged to create a profile on the website/app so the experience can be customized to them (i.e. the local homeless shelters, soup kitchens, showers, etc., will be pinpointed on a map for them)

# Challenges
- Inexperience with web servers
- No user feedback
- Lack of knowledge about homeless people's daily lives

# Future Goals
- Including a stack overflow-like thread where users can ask questions and give advice about various topics in the area (ex. what areas are dangerous, what resources proved to be most beneficial, etc.)
- Distributing an interactive display equipped with our app to places struck by natural disasters/war/other crises to make sure victims get adequate support
- Track user data so cities can help coordinate resources to people in need more efficiently
